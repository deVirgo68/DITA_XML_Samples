# DITA_XML_Samples

<b>Hello and welcome to my first Github Repository:  <i>DITA_XML_Samples</i> repository (repo)!</b>

So far, I have completed the following courses through <a href="https://jpdocu.teachable.com/" target="_blank"><b><i>JPDocu School of Technical Writing</b></i></a> (Thank you for the great courses).

  <ol>
    <li>How to Get Started with Technical Writing - Mini Course</li>
    <li>A Quick Start to Technical Writing with DITA - Mini Course</li>
    <li>How to Build a DITA XML Tecnical Writing Portfolio</li>
  </ol>

In the <i>JPS_Calculator_DITA_Sample</i> folder, you will find my efforts from the <b><i>How to Build a DITA XML Technical Writing Portfolio</b></i>.

  <p>Source Documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Main ditamap file</li>
      <li>DITA concept and task files</li>
      <li>Calculator image files (taken from my iPhone)</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Output Documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/deVirgo68/DITA_XML_Samples/blob/main/JPS_Calculator_DITA_Sample/out/html5/index.html" target = "_blank">HTML5</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/deVirgo68/DITA_XML_Samples/blob/main/JPS_Calculator_DITA_Sample/out/pdf-css-html5/darleneevanoff_jps_calculator_software.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></li>
    </ul>
      
<p><b>What I learned through this work:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoyed using the <b></i>Oxygen XML Author 25.0 (build 2022110706)</b></i> program to create the files (you can check out this tool <a href="http://oxygenxml.com" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
  <li>How to write tasks and concepts using DITA</li>
  <li>How to organize the components of the Ditamap in the tool</li>
  <li>How to generate output from the authoring tool</li>
  <li>How to upload and share source files in Github</li>
  <li>How to upload and share output in Github</li>
  <li>What to put in, and how to create a Githug README.MD</i>
</ul>
  <p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Structured and modular writing is fun!</li>
  <li>My favorite views of the work in progress in the authoring tool are the actual XML itself (text mode in my chosen tool)!</li>
  <li>I would like to explore other DITA/XML authoring tools</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Self assessment:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The links in the tasks to the concepts worked well in the HTML but not as well in the PDF</li>
  <li>I don't really like the way the PDF handled the tables with the images (it split across pages) - stay tuned for an improvement!</li>
  <li>Now, knowing that an <i>index.html</i> file is created, I might link back to the index from the concepts and tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize I am only getting started, but the possibilities seem endless.  I hope this demonstrates an initial understanding of DITA and structured authoring.</p>

<p>Thank you for checking out my repository and if you'd like to reach me, <a href="mailto:darleneevanoff@gmail.com">send an email!</a></p>
